# 🌏 GoPlanner – Travel Recommendation & Trip Planning Web App

GoPlanner is a web-based travel planning platform designed to help users discover attractions, filter points of interest, check real-time population levels, and generate personalised travel itineraries.

This project was developed as part of a university team collaboration. My main responsibilities include front-end feature development, UI optimisation, and API integration.
